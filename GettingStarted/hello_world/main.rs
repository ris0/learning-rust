// defines a function
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// rustc [filename] commands to compile the file
// ./main runs the program

// println! calls a rust macro. If it called a function instead, it would be entered as println without the !

// after compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable
